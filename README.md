# Assignment-1
I wrote both of the sorting codes by myself 
after reading lecture slides from my data structure class.

Selection Sort (sort2)
It searches the smallest element every time in a loop and swaps 
it to the currect position.
Times to run: 12061 ms


Bubble sort (sort1) 
It compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps it if 
they are in wrong order. i.e compare each two (except the last) 
with its neighbor to the right and places the highest one to the right
Time Taken to run: 33501 ms (This sorting algorith is not good 
for this assignment. It takes too much time to compile and run the program. )
